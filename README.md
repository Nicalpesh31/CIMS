# CIMS Project - Question Paper Generator

## Introduction

The Computerized Integrated Management System (CIMS) project aims to develop an automated system for generating question papers and managing related data for educational institutes. The system addresses the challenge of creating balanced exam papers while ensuring non-repetitiveness and adherence to specified constraints.

## Problem Statement

Educational institutes often face difficulties in creating diverse and balanced question papers for exams. Teachers typically maintain a question bank, but manual selection and arrangement of questions can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The CIMS project offers a solution by automating the process of generating question papers based on predefined criteria and constraints.

## Features

- **Automated Question Paper Generation:** The system automatically selects questions from the question bank based on specified constraints provided by the user.
- **Role-based Hierarchy:** The system implements a role-based hierarchy with four user roles - Admin, HOD (Head of Department), Teacher, and Student. Each role has specific privileges and restrictions.
- **Data Management:** The system allows users to enter, edit, and manage data related to courses, syllabus, curriculum, and question bank with ease.
- **Duplication Prevention:** The system prohibits the duplication of question papers, ensuring that each paper is unique.
- **Fast Operations and Data Storage:** The system is designed for fast operations and efficient data storage, catering to the needs of educational institutes with limited staff and resources.
- **Security:** The system ensures high security for all tasks, with access restricted based on user roles and permissions.
- **Access to Previous Papers:** Teachers can access all previously generated papers for reference, facilitating exam preparation and evaluation.
- **Email Integration:** The system provides an option to email generated question papers in PDF format to examiners, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

## User Roles

1. **Admin:**
   - Analyze data regarding HODs, Teachers, and Students.
   - Add users such as HODs, Teachers, and Students.

2. **HOD:**
   - Manage Teachers and Students, including creating accounts for them.

3. **Teacher:**
   - Manage Students, including creating accounts and generating question papers.

4. **Student:**
   - Upload assignments and practicals.
   - Take exams and view results.

## Conclusion

The CIMS project offers a comprehensive solution for automated question paper generation and data management in educational institutes. By leveraging technology, the system aims to streamline the exam preparation process, enhance efficiency, and ensure the quality and integrity of assessments.
